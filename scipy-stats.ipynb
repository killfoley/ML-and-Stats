    "### A Jupyter Notebook exploring the Scipy.Stats module for Python. [scipy.stats offfical](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)\n",
    "The Scipy.Stats module for Python offers a wide array of probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and statistical tests, masked statistics, kernel density estimation, quasi-Monte Carlo functionality, and more. Since statistics is such a large discipline and covers many areas, there are other Python modules for areas such as machine learning, classification, regression, model selection and so on.<br> \n",
    "One particular area of interest for the purpose of this demonstration is statistical testing.\n",
    "#### ANOVA Testing\n",
    "One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing is performed on 2 or more independent groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of the groups. The test is generally performed on three or more groups with a t-test being performed when there are two groups, however for the purpose of this example a one-way ANOVA will be used. [Laerd Statistics](https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/one-way-anova-using-spss-statistics.php)<br>\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "As part of the one-way ANOVA process, the data must be checked against 6 assumptions to ensure that the data can actually be analysed using a one-way ANOVA. Each of the 6 assumptions will be explored further in this notebook.\n",
    "* **Assumption 1** - The dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* **Assumption 2** - \n"
