# Exploring Scipy.stats and Scikit-Learn python packages
## Project Description
In the repository are two jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) one for each of the 2 python packages. In these notebooks I explore various functions available from Scipy.Stats and Scikit-learn. 

#### A background on each of the packages
**Scikit-learn**  
Machine learning is a technique used in data analysis that performs model building with very little programming input. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that machines can learn from data to predict outcomes or identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Regression - Linear/ polynomial
Classification

**Scipy.Stats**  
Statistics is an extremely important area of data analysis. It is best described as the science of collecting, organising, analysing, interpreting and presenting data hence it's importance in the field of data analysis. Scipy.Stats is one part of the Scipy library designation to statistics. It contains a large number of probability distributions, correlation functions and statistical tests to name just a few. It is reliant on the ubiquitous Numpy package in Python. 

## Installation
I personally installed the popular Anaconda data science package which contains a very large number of popular Python packages including jupyter notebooks. However the option to run the notebooks without Anaconda is detailed below.
